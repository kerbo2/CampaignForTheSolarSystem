# Campaign For The Solar System

A vassal implementation of Campaign for the Solar System. Best played with 4 players but it can work with 2 or 3. System, ruleset, lore and orbital system/map layout by Kaydevs. Vassal implementation by me w/ testing and design help from friends :)

-CHANGELOG-


*V0.9 is the most up to date version and contains fixes for major resource calculation issues from earlier versions.*
*V0.8 represents the first playable build.*



# Suggested additional rules for playing:

1)
Rather then being unable to change transfer directions in flight, all ships have a single in-flight transfer direction change. This abstracts high energy maneuvers and natural apogee/perigees of orbits. This does not impact retrograde/prograde motion, which can only be changed at POIs. 


2)
Player turns should be internally structured. The internal structure should follow the pace of Movement>production>loading/unloading. This stops gamey between-ship movement chaining, while still allowing for delivering needed supplies.
