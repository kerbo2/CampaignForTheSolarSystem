# The Campaign For The Solar System

A vassal implementation of Campaign for the Solar System. Best played with 4 players but it can work with 2 or 3. System, ruleset, lore and orbital system/map layout by Kaydevs. Vassal implementation by me w/ testing and design help from friends :)

-CHANGELOG-

*0.95 introduces a rework of the production info UI and has improved ship graphics/info. 

*V0.9 is the most up to date version and contains fixes for major resource calculation issues from earlier versions.*

*V0.8 represents the first playable build. Multiple production related bugs*



# Suggested additional rules for playing:

1)
Rather then being unable to change transfer directions in flight, all ships have a single in-flight transfer direction change. This abstracts high energy maneuvers and natural apogee/perigees of orbits. This does not impact retrograde/prograde motion, which can only be changed at POIs. This enables more complex orbital movements and prevents ship softlocking.


2)
Player turns should be internally structured. The internal structure should follow the pace of Movement>production>loading/unloading. This stops gamey between-ship movement chaining, while still allowing for delivering needed supplies.
